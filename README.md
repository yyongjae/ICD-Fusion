## Installation
1.  Prepare for the running environment.

    You can  follow the installation steps in [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) or download our [conda environment pack](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uvVdnXWiU57W0tTQeFzMXg?pwd=9264) for easy deployment:

    ```
    cd /user/anaconda3/envs
    mkdir your_env_name
    tar -xzvf your_env_name.tar.gz -C /user/anaconda3/envs/your_env_name
    ```
    
    **NOTE :** Our released implementation is tested on: Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.7~3.9 (3.9 recommended), Pytorch 2.0.1, cuda 11.8, RTX 4090 (or 3090, 4070) GPUs.


2. Prepare for the data.

* Please download the official [KITTI 3D object detection](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) dataset and organize the downloaded files as follows (the road planes could be downloaded from [[road plane]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5mq0RXRnvHPVeKx6Q612z0YRO1t2wAp/view?usp=sharing), which are optional for data augmentation in the training):
    ```
    ICDFusion
    â”œâ”€â”€ data
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kitti
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ ImageSets
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ training
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€calib & velodyne & label_2 & image_2 & (optional: planes) & (optional: depth_2)
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ testing
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€calib & velodyne & image_2
    â”œâ”€â”€ pcdet
    â”œâ”€â”€ tools
    ```
* Generate the data infos by running the following command: 
    ```
    python -m pcdet.datasets.kitti.kitti_dataset create_kitti_infos tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/kitti_dataset.yaml
    ```
    **NOTE :** If you put KITTI dataset in another directory, please replace the `ROOT_PATH` in `pcdet.datasets.kitti.kitti_dataset` with your customized path before running the above command. 

    Anyway, the final data structure should be organized as follows:

    ```
    ICDFusion
    â”œâ”€â”€ data
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kitti
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ ImageSets
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ training
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€calib & velodyne & label_2 & image_2 & (optional: planes) & velodyne_reduced
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ testing
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€calib & velodyne & image_2 & velodyne_reduced
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ gt_database
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ kitti_dbinfos_train.pkl
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ kitti_infos_test.pkl
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ kitti_infos_train.pkl
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ kitti_infos_trainval.pkl

    â”œâ”€â”€ pcdet
    â”œâ”€â”€ tools
    ```

3. Setup
    ```
    cd ICDFusion
    python setup.py develop
    ```

## Getting Started
0. Preparation

    Following the instructions offered by [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet), we pretrained Voxel-RCNN as teacher model in our ICD framework. You can directly download the pretrained weights [here](). The choice of the teacher model remains flexible, as long as the encoder's output maintains the same size with student model. Following [BEVFusion](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/bevfusion), you also need to download [SwinTransformer]() pretrained model as the image encoder in our dual-branch encoder.

1. Training
    ```
    cd tools
    python3 train.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/ICDfusion.yaml
    ```

2. Evaluation 
    ```
    cd tools
    python3 test.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} --ckpt ${CKPT}
    ```

3. Model Selection
    
    You can use `select_AP40.py` for optimal model selection. Before the analysis, you should set your path to result logfile written by Tensorboard. The logfile is usually under the path: `/ICDFusion/output`
